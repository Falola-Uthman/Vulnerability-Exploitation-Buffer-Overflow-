# Vulnerability Exploitation (Buffer Overflow)



## Objective

This project, dives into the security risks associated with software vulnerabilities, focusing on the intricacies of buffer overflow attacks. It aims to highlight the importance of embedding security within the development lifecycle, in contrast to treating it as an afterthought. Through hands-on experimentation with buffer overflows, the project seeks to demonstrate how overlooking security can lead to system compromises and data breaches.

## Skills Learned

- Vulnerability Creation: Learned the mechanics of buffer overflow by deliberately creating vulnerable code.
- Game Design: Conceived and developed a Rock-Paper-Scissors game in C with buffer overflow vulnerabilities to understand the security flaws that can arise during development.
- Vulnerability Identification: Learned to identify buffer overflow vulnerabilities within software applications.
- Exploit Development: Learned how to develop exploits that take advantage of buffer overflow vulnerabilities, deepening my understanding of how attackers could leverage such weaknesses.
- Secure Coding Practices: Developed a proficiency in secure coding standards to minimize the introduction of vulnerabilities.
- Vulnerability Analysis: Used debugging and memory inspection tools to analyze how the overflow modifies the program's control flow.
- Memory Corruption Understanding: Gained a deeper understanding of memory management in programming and how improper handling can lead to security breaches.
- Risk Assessment: Enhanced my capacity to evaluate the security posture of software and the potential impact of vulnerabilities.

## Tools Used

- Debugger: Used debuggers to analyze and trace the execution of code to understand how buffer overflows occur.
- Programming Languages: Employed C and Python for developing and testing buffer overflow scenarios.
- GCC Compiler: Used to compile the game, with options to disable certain security features for educational purposes.


## Steps

- Game Development: Programmed a Rock-Paper-Scissors game in C, intentionally leaving a buffer overflow vulnerability.
- Exploit Development: Designed a proof-of-concept exploit to demonstrate the vulnerability within the game.
- Behavior Analysis: Deployed the GNU Debugger to trace the buffer overflow as it overwrote memory sections and to understand its impact on the game's execution.
- Mitigation Application: Applied countermeasures within the code, such as stricter input validation and memory boundary checks.
- Testing and Validation: Tested the game with the applied security measures to ensure the overflow could no longer be exploited.
- Documentation and Reporting: Prepared detailed documentation to capture the entire process of exploitation and mitigation, highlighting the learning points and the importance of security in software development.
